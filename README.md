This repository hosts the final dissertation submitted by Jeet Parashar for the MSc in Data Science for Business at the University of Stirling, September 2025. The report presents an extensive consultancy project that investigates Scotland’s transport equity landscape, showcasing the potential of data-driven approaches to improve both environmental and social outcomes.

Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the clear divide between urban and rural transportation in Scotland, with Edinburgh representing the urban case and Stirling as the rural focus. My research seeks to answer: How accessible and satisfactory is public bus transport for residents in these contrasting settings? And, what are the environmental implications of current systems?

Key objectives included

1. Identifying service gaps in bus accessibility.

2. Analyzing changes in public satisfaction with bus transport from 2005 to 2025.

3. Evaluating integration of buses with cycle hire (NextBike) services.

4. Tracking demand trends and their environmental impacts.

Methodology

Using public open datasets (such as NaPTAN bus stops, Scottish Household Surveys, NextBike trip data, and national emission records), I applied rigorous data cleaning and advanced analytics in Power BI. Visual tools like interactive maps and time-series charts helped reveal not just high-level trends but local realities on the ground.

Main Findings

Urban-Rural Divide

Edinburgh’s bus network is dense and accessible (2,479 stops), while rural Stirling is underserviced, with many communities having only 1–2 bus stops.

Satisfaction Gap

Residents in urban areas consistently report 80%+ satisfaction with bus services. In contrast, those in rural Stirling have volatile and much lower satisfaction—sometimes dropping below 50%.

Integration Issues

Cycle hire stations (NextBike) in Stirling are mainly clustered downtown and near the university, rarely providing last-mile access for those living in outlying areas.

Demand Trends

Bus usage is slowly recovering post-pandemic, but cycle hire activity dropped sharply by 75% (2022–2024).

Emissions Impact

The transport sector contributes nearly a third of Scotland’s total emissions, with rural Stirling surpassing the national per capita average due to car dependence.

Recommendations

1. Expand rural bus and cycling services further from city centers.

2. Implement integrated bus-bike ticketing, electric bus fleets, and employer-subsidy schemes to incentivize use.

3. Increase targeted funding for rural transport, and improve satisfaction monitoring specifically for remote areas.

4. Advance policies in sync with Scotland’s Net Zero 2045 target, emphasizing both fair access and sustainability.

Contribution

By bringing real datasets into a single analytical framework, this dissertation both documents Scotland’s transport challenges and demonstrates how open data and visualization can influence policy and practical solutions. The goal: Deliver actionable evidence to bridge gaps in mobility, social inclusion, and carbon-neutral objectives—making transport work for everyone, everywhere.
